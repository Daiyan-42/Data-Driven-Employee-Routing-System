"""Solver parity + invariant test — no database, no backend server needed.

Feeds `../data/full_test_data.json` straight through `solve_night` and checks the
result. Two passes:

1. **OSRM pass** (skipped when no OSRM server answers on localhost:5000) —
   asserts the exact counts the notebook produced, so the port is provably
   faithful rather than merely plausible.
2. **Haversine pass** (always runs) — asserts only the structural invariants,
   because straight-line distances legitimately produce a different schedule.
   This is what proves the no-OSRM deploy still emits a valid night.

Invariants checked in both passes:

- accounting: every request is either routed or reported unassigned, exactly once
- fleet state: no vehicle is on two overlapping trips
- capacity: no route carries more passengers than its vehicle's seats
- Case A: fixed-route stops exist for the 22:00/23:00 shifts
- Case D: the 07:30 drop-off consolidates onto Agargaon Metro
  (this one is load-bearing — it silently disappears if request zones are NULL)

Run:  python test_solver_parity.py
