"""Automatic routing scheduler.

Two unattended passes, driven by a background loop started from the FastAPI
lifespan:

- Weekly: the current calendar week is always safe to route — its Friday/
  Saturday request window closed at the end of last week. The first loop tick
  of each new week (within a minute of the Saturday deadline passing) routes
  the whole week's pending requests in advance.
- Ad-hoc: each service day is re-routed at/just after 7 PM (when ad-hoc
  submissions close, three hours before the 10 PM shift) to fold in the day's
  ad-hoc requests.

An admin override endpoint can trigger the weekly pass on demand.

    deadline comparison — it just must not repeat. `pending_counts` only counts
    un-routed rows, so already-solved dates (this pass earlier, or a process
    restart) are skipped automatically.

    Idempotent by replacement: each service date's previous solve is deleted and
    rewritten, so re-runs converge rather than duplicating routes.

    Note this can take minutes per service date — the solver simulates the whole
    night and queries OSRM — so never call it directly from the event loop. Both
