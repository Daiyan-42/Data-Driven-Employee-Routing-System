"""Routing engine: the real solver behind the admin "run routing" actions.

    from app.services.routing import solve_night, get_provider

Layering is deliberate and worth keeping:

- `config`   — policy constants, no logic
- `solver`   — PURE algorithm; no DB, no HTTP, no clock. Offline-testable, which
               is what makes `test_solver_parity.py` possible.
- `distance` — the only module that talks to the network (OSRM, with a
               haversine fallback)
- `adapter`  — DB rows in
- `writer`   — DB rows out

`routing_service.py` is the thin orchestrator over these.
