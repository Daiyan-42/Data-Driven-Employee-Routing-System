"""Routing orchestration: load → solve → persist.

This module used to *be* the router: it sliced requests into capacity-sized
chunks, ordered them nearest-neighbour, and wrote a row per stop. That
placeholder is what the frontend has been displaying. The real algorithm now
lives in `app.services.routing` and this file is the thin seam that connects it
to the database.

**Why every entry point solves the whole night.** The algorithm simulates fleet
state across the entire service date — where each car is, when it is next free,
how many seats are left. A pickup route's end position determines which car can
serve which drop-off six hours later. Solving pickups alone would leave every
vehicle's end-of-night position undefined and make the drop-off pass infeasible,
so `run_pickup_routing` runs the full solve and reports its pickup half. The
admin UI is labelled accordingly.

The public surface is unchanged, so `app/scheduler.py`, `app/routers/admin.py`,
`route_service`, the driver views and the frontend all keep working.
